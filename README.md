binary - compiled project ;
creator - person who started the project ;
contributor - person who helped the creator or fixed the project ;
coder - person who wants to modify the code and publish it ;
user - person who just wants to use the binary ;

SO:

User can always use the binary and redistribute it but he must provide link to the project's website.
Coder is allowed to do anything with the code and publish modified version (remember to include information that it's based on the project, and provide link to the project's website). Coder is also allowed to change the licence but the creator must be able to acces source of modified version.
Contributors are always welcome, and their help too, but remember that your contributions become part of the project (if accepted) and so they belong to the creator.
All contributors must be listed (name/nickname, email, and website) in special file included in the project.
This license applies to all files of the project (except if the file says otherwise), and should be shipped with it.
Project can't become close-sourced if any contributor disagrees within 1 week after announcement. Creator should announce his plans on closing the code and wait for 1 week before doing so.
